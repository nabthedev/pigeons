        <h1 class="headline">Pigeons Form Political Party, Demand More Public Statues</h1>
        <div class="byline">By Penelope Quill — Staff Writer</div>
        <div class="dek">Members of the newly formed "Feathered Front" occupied rooftops across the city this morning, presenting an 18-point manifesto calling for increased monument funding, a daily breadcrumb stipend, and official co-governance seats at town hall.</div>

        <div class="body" id="article-body">
          <p>In a move city officials described as "both historic and mildly inconvenient," thousands of pigeons assembled at dawn to inaugurate the Feathered Front, a political party formed entirely by birds. Witnesses say the birds arrived in precise formations, cooing their manifesto and chaining themselves to lampposts until their demands were heard.</p>

          <p class="pull-quote">"All we ask is one statue per square mile, and better access to public breadcrumbs." — Anonymous Pigeon (translated)</p>

          <p class="subhead">Bread and Representation</p>
          <p>The party—whose leaders include a charismatic pigeon known only as Commander Peck and a strategist named Madame Feathers—produced a manifesto that called for the erection of small-scale statues in every park and civic square. Officials say the proposal includes provisions for maintenance funding, legal personhood for select birds, and a guaranteed daily crumb allowance for registered feathered citizens.</p>

          <p>"It's difficult to negotiate with someone who quotes poetry while stealing your sandwich," said councilwoman Rita Humbolt, who met with the party representatives at City Hall. "But their demands are surprisingly specific."</p>

          <h4 class="subhead">Public Reaction</h4>
          <p>Reactions among residents have been mixed. Some praised the pigeons' civic engagement, citing a long history of overlooked contributions to urban culture. Others worried about logistics—chief among them, how to fund what the Feathered Front calls the "Monumental Initiative" without diverting funds from sidewalks and public toilets.</p>

          <p>Local baker Marco Gianni voiced a common concern: "If there's a daily breadcrumb stipend, where does that leave our regular customers?"</p>

          <h4 class="subhead">International Interest</h4>
          <p>Ambassadors from nearby cities have reportedly reached out, and there's talk of a continental coalition of avian parties. "We've had inquiries from seagulls and a particularly forward-thinking flock of starlings," said urban sociologist Dr. Lila Kemsley. "This could be the beginning of interspecies politics as we know it."</p>

          <p>The Feathered Front announced plans for a ceremonial unveiling of their first proposed statue—a twelve-inch bronze figure titled <em>Percher of the People</em>—to take place on the steps of the central library next Tuesday.</p>

          <h4 class="subhead">Legal Questions</h4>
          <p>Legal experts are already debating the ramifications of granting any form of legal recognition to the group. "If pigeons are allowed representation, we must define the limits clearly," said civil rights attorney June Park. "Can they vote? Can they be elected? Who cleans up after campaign rallies?"</p>

          <p>Mayor Caldwell said the city will form a joint committee to discuss the matter, but warned that "we cannot have statues blocking crosswalks."</p>
